
Note: 

OpenCTF can be used without running the build script.

The build scripts are only neccessary for OpenCTF developers.

They may be used to compile and run the example test projects
and to build the distribution package.

Required tools:

- to run the build script, Apache Ant 1.7 is required

- doxygen and pas2dox are required to build the documentation (copy pas2dox.exe to the "make" folder)
